Problem Definition
------------------
You will be provided with a Grid object read in from a document. You will have to use the data in the grid to answer these questions.

Lines may not all be of the same length, it is assumed that tiles after the line end are all blank.
The edges of the grid are hard edges, they do not wrap around like a cylinder or torus.
For tiles to be considered connected, they must must both have connections to each other. 
For example if Tile 1 is to the left of Tile 2, then Tile 1 must have a connection right and Tile 2 must have a connection left to be considered connected. 
If either of those directions is missing, then the tiles are not considered connected.

EX:
These tiles connect:
 ╠═
Printed as:
[G  ↑↓→][G ←  →]
These tiles do not connect:
╣═
Printed as:
[G ←↑↓ ][G ←  →]


Questions
---------
1. Determine if all sinks can be connected to a source.
    a) For each sink that cannot be connected, output a message with the (0 indexed) coordinates of the sink that can’t be connected.
2. Determine if all sources can be connected to a sink.
    a) For each source that cannot be connected, output a message with the (0 indexed) coordinates of the source that can’t be connected.

Notes
-----
Please do not submit hidden files (.idea, .DS_Store, Thumbs.db, etc) with your solution.
